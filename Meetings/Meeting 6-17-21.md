## Meeting minutes:

Everett is setting up the UI skelliton. API skelliton is build, and the Fellowship of the POJO is creating the entities tonight.

Typedoc: Similar to the auto generated javadocs we will be using typedoc to automatically generate documentation. We will probably all have to 
take some time to familiarize ourselves with typedoc use.

 Commenting: Verbose commit messages are best practice. Go into detail.
 
 Tasks: Rather than assign a user story to one or more devs, it's probably best to allow people to pick their own. Pair up in teams, spread out the experience. 
  Break the user story into a number of smaller tasks, outline those as a checklist in the card on Trello. No more than one user story at a time
  per developer or group. 
  
 Trello is the central nexus for work. Check it often, and utilize it for blockers, issues, etc. Slack is still the best tool for communication.
