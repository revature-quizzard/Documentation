### Progress
Based on the semi-arbitrary point values we generated with planning poker, the user stories marked green in trello (4-12 points) should be nearly complete. Don't be concerned 
if you aren't nearly complete, if you have been putting in the effort that probably just means we underestimated the tasks. If you have blockers and think you aren't nearing 
completion of one of these smaller user stories please mention it. 

### Blockers
Some common blockers that have come up include Redux, Styling, UI testing, and data persistence. 

#### Redux and styling:
Try not to let these block you too hard for now. If you are blocked on styling, just make it presentable and useful. Don't let beautification block you.
If you are blocked on Redux, stick with JS/React code you are comfortable with for now and a Redux refactor can come later. Kyle will be speakign with Everett about
Redux implementation ASAP. Redux is a requirement for this project, so consider researching it as well if it's a blocker for you.

#### Data persistence: 
We have a few more circular references to iron out, and some connections listed on the ERD are missing. We actually already conviened to implement a fix that is now in pre_dev.
Pull down from pre_dev to get the most recent entity changes. If you get stack overflows when querying, persisting, or marshalling entity data, please let us know. 
Sheckeem, Richard, Kyle, Nicholas, and Sean are all familiar with the issue. We hope that it is now in the past for good.

#### UI Testing
UI side unit testing is something many of us seem to lack experience in. We will need to familiarize outselves with the testing technologies. Also the documentation library 
Typedoc should be used to create javadoc like documentation out of in-line comments. Because the repos are separate, we can push API side changes that are properly unit tested 
and circle back to UI unit testing and documentation. We shouldn't wait for this too long though. Unit testing techs: Jest and Enzyme.

#### Conclusion
We are now past the opening hump, and trucking along nicely. We aren't yet falling behind yet, but I forsee blockers coming up and dragging our progress down. Please feel free 
to reach out to anyone if you have any questions or blocking at all. We're all one team.
